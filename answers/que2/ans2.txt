Signifivance of resource class in flask-restful
1) Resource class is the main building block provided by flast-restful which will contail resource objects
   Eg:  from flask_restful import Resource

	class Foo(Resource):
    		def get(self):
        		pass
    		def post(self):
        		pass 
    
2) It gives easy access to multiple HTTP methods just by defining methods on your resource
3) Multiple URLs can be passed through resources .Each one will be routed to the resource

   Eg: api.add_resource(HelloWorld,
    			'/',
    			'/hello')



Job of dispatch_request method: 
Whenever the request is dispatched a new instance of the class is created and the dispatch_request() method is called with the parameters from the URL. The class itself is instantiated with the parameters passed to the as_view() function.
Subclasses have to override this method to implement the actual view function code.
dispatch_request does the request dispatching. Matches the URL and returns the return value of the view or error handler. This does not have to be a response object. In order to convert the return value to a proper response object, call make_response().

Eg: def dispatch_request(self, name):
        return 'Hello %s!' % name
